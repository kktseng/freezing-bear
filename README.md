freezing-bear
=============

Freezing-bear is an open-source web app that allows multiple users to collaborate to draw pictures and chat in real time.

These pictures can be drawn with images searched from online APIs (Flickr, Tumblr, Instagram) or with a simple pen tool.

The main goal of this project was to toy with websockets and image APIs, so it may be a little hacky ;).
